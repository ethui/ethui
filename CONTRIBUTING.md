We welcome all kinds of contributions:

- Issues suggesting new features or bug reports
- Pull requests
- Newcomers to web3 / blockchain looking to learn and perhaps help along the way.

You can also [chat with us directly][contact] for questions and feedback

## But how?

Here's a few suggestions on how to get started:

1. Download and run the project yourself. Use it with your existing projects. Report back feedback and features you'd like to see.
2. Provide context or ideas for existing documented features. Anything we're missing, or any concrete suggestion for how to tackle a feature?
3. Resolving issues. Perhaps the [`good-first-issue`][good-first-issue] label is a good place to start.

## Code of Conduct

We adhere to the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc], which describes expected minimum behaviour we expect from all contributors. Please [contact us][contact] in case of any violations.
