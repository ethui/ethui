### Requirements

- Rust

- Yarn
- Google Chrome (a profile without MetaMask installed)
- [justfile][justfile]
- [watchexec][watchexec]

### Get started

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```sh
git clone git@github.com:subvisual/iron
cd iron
just setup
```

Now start the development server:

```sh
just dev
```

On the first run, you'll also need to install the development extension.

1. Open Google Chrome
2. go to `chrome://extensions`
3. enable `Developer mode` (upper right corner)
4. Load unpacked -> choose the `iron/extension/dist` directory
5. Iron should now be running

For future runs, you may jus need to reload it on `chrome://extensions`.
