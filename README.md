## Security

**Right now there is none.**
Our "go to market strategy" is to help developers looking to speed up their feedback loop. This means:

- mnemonic defaults to `test test test ... junk`
- no encryption, no passwords to input all the time. just a plain HD Wallet
- no annoying popups for confirmations, gas estimates, etc (they'll come, but opt-in)
- no need to "Reset your Account" to reset the `nonce`

This will change [very very soon](https://github.com/iron-wallet/iron/pull/185) thought, but more future work will include:
- other 3rd party encryption software (e.g.: GPG)
- Hardware wallets
- WalletConnect

## Installing

1. Check the latest [release][releases]
2. Download the appropriate binary for your architecture, and set it up in your `$PATH`
3. Download `extension.zip` and manually install it in your browser (currently tested on Google Chrome, more to come soon):
   3.1. Extract the zip file
   3.2. go to `chrome://extensions`
   3.3. enable `Developer mode` (upper right corner)
   3.4. Load unpacked -> choose the directory you extracted from the ZIP file
4. Run `iron`.

## Building from source

### Requirements

Iron is a [Tauri application]. Tauri's requirements are all that should be needed to build the wallet.
You'll also need Google Chrome, running a profile without MetaMask or other wallet installed, to be solved once EIP-6963 is widely adopted)


You may also like to use optional [justfile][justfile], if you prefer that over `yarn`.

### Get started

**1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:subvisual/iron && cd iron
```

**2. Run the initial build**, which will install dependencies and build the extension `dist`:

```sh
yarn setup
```

**3. Install the extension**

1. Open Google Chrome
2. go to `chrome://extensions`
3. enable `Developer mode` (upper right corner)
4. Load unpacked -> choose the `iron/extension/dist` directory
5. Iron should now be running

**4. Start the app in development mode**

```sh
yarn app:dev
```

**Note:** If you change the extension' code, you may also need to use `yarn extension:dev`, and to manually reload it on `chrome://extensions`. Live code reloading is tricky with these.
