## What is ethui?

A developer's crypto wallet. ethui has the usual functionality of a crypto wallet, as well as additional built-in tooling meant to speed up your development workflows.

### Main features

- **anvil-aware**: ethui uses a dedicated syncing process for local [anvil][anvil] nodes, enabling real-time syncing which works across chain restarts, reverts, and downtime. No longer should you have to manually reset the `nonce` in your wallet
- **foundry-aware**: the wallet finds existing `forge` outputs in your filesystem, and matches them against on-chain bytecode to create a built-in explorer akin to Etherscan's contract interaction tool
- **multiple wallets**: ethui is not restricted to a single mnemonic. Create as many wallets as you want, and switch seamlessly between them
- **Desktop-native experience**: no longer tied to a browser's sandbox. Your wallet is now reachable across your entire system, and you can even use it as a proxy for your scripting RPC needs
- **quick keyboard-based navigation**: A command bar reachable via `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` provides quick access to all of the major actions

## Status

ethui is in active development, but the existing features are more than to provide an enhanced developer experience over consumer-facing wallets.

## Installing

1. Check the latest [release][releases]
2. Download the appropriate binary for your architecture, and set it up in your `$PATH`
3. Download `extension.zip` and manually install it in your browser (currently tested on Google Chrome, more to come soon):
